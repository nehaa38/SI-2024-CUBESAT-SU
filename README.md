- A CubeSat is a miniature spacecraft with a volume of from 1 to 3 liters and a mass from 1 to 3 kg. California Polytechnic State University and Stanford University developed the CubeSat specifications to help universities worldwide
to perform space science and exploration. CubeSats provide an opportunity for students to learn about satellites and
engineering.
## ATTRIBUTES
- Small Size: CubeSats are typically small, cubic-shaped satellites with standardized dimensions. The most common sizes are 1U (10 cm x 10 cm x 10 cm), 2U, and 3U, although larger configurations exist (e.g., 6U, 12U).

- Modularity: They are built using standardized components and interfaces, making them highly modular and easy to assemble. This modularity allows for cost-effective manufacturing and rapid deployment.

- Low Cost: CubeSats are relatively inexpensive compared to traditional satellites, making them accessible to universities, research institutions, and even some commercial entities.

- Educational and Research Purposes: CubeSats are often used for educational purposes, providing students and researchers with hands-on experience in satellite design, development, and operation. They also facilitate scientific research in various disciplines such as Earth observation, space weather monitoring, and technology demonstration.

- Short Development Cycles: Due to their small size and standardized components, CubeSats can be developed and launched relatively quickly compared to larger satellites.
